I am pursuing a Web Development Internship and are working on my 2nd task.

# ⏱️ Stopwatch Web Application

This project is a simple yet functional **Stopwatch Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times. It's perfect for tracking time intervals or learning how web timers work.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Start the timer
- ⏸ Pause anytime
- 🔄 Reset the stopwatch
- 📝 Lap functionality to record time checkpoints
- 📱 Fully responsive layout
- ✨ Clean and modern UI

 
## 📁 Project Structure

- **HTML** – Structure of the page
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Stopwatch logic and interactivity

## 🚀 Getting Started

Just open `index.html` in any modern browser — no setup required.

## 📌 How It Works

- JavaScript uses `setInterval` to update the time every second.
- Lap records are stored in a list and dynamically added to the page.
- Fully responsive using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
