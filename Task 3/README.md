# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

## 📌 Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on the board. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled without any winner, the match ends in a draw.

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation designed to demonstrate basic programming logic and game development concepts.

## ✨ Features

✔️ Two Player Mode – Play as X and O on the same device.
✔️ Win Detection – Automatically checks for winner (rows, columns, diagonals).
✔️ Draw Detection – Declares a draw when the board is full.
✔️ Restart/Reset Option – Quickly restart the game without refreshing.
✔️ Responsive Design – Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile (if web-based).
✔️ Clean Code – Beginner-friendly structure with clear logic.
